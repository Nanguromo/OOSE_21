How to compile:
 - Within the Assignment_2 directory, simply type "ant" 

How to run:
 - Go to the "dist" directory and write "java -jar MarsRoverApplication.java"
 - Will loop forever, so when you are ready to exit, type "Ctr + C"

Testing:
 - Within the Rover API's EarthComm Class, simply comment out different String cmd variations and re-compile
 - Can also put your own variation
 - Important to note, this is just stub code. The real implementation will be put here, but for functionality testing, I have added the stubs.
